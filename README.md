this game actually started as a prototype to teach myself unity vr and level design, so it taught me about VR, and about the prototyping process, my main take away was that even when just prototyping a mechanic, i should probably plan my architecture a bit more in case said prototype ends up turning into a full game and then i dont have to refactor a bunch of stuff later.
learned about how unity handles vr inputs and controller locations and space. level design is additionally something that is difficult and requiers a lot of prior planning, but the upside of prototyping is that if a level design just does not fundementally work, you can get rid of it.
